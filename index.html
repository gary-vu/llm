The Amazon rainforest, also known as the Amazon jungle, is a vast tropical rainforest in South America. It is the largest rainforest in the world, covering over 5.5 million square kilometers. The Amazon River, which runs through the rainforest, is the second-longest river in the world after the Nile. The region is home to a rich diversity of wildlife, including jaguars, sloths, and anacondas.
